Forex = Foreign Exchange = Trading currencies

Example: EUR/USD = 1.1850
- This means 1 Euro = 1.1850 US Dollars
- If it goes to 1.1900, Euro got stronger
- If it goes to 1.1800, Euro got weaker

HOW YOU MAKE MONEY:
- Buy EUR/USD at 1.1850
- Price goes up to 1.1900
- You made 50 pips (0.0050) profit
- With $1000 position = $50 profit

HOW YOU LOSE MONEY:
- Buy EUR/USD at 1.1850
- Price goes down to 1.1800
- You lost 50 pips
- With $1000 position = $50 loss

The bot looks at 5 things to decide:

1. TREND - Is price going up or down?
   üìà If price is above average = Uptrend = Maybe BUY
   üìâ If price is below average = Downtrend = Maybe SELL

2. MOMENTUM - Is the move strong?
   üöÄ Strong momentum = More confident
   üêå Weak momentum = Less confident

3. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Is it overbought/oversold?
   üî¥ RSI > 70 = Overbought (price too high) = Maybe SELL
   üü¢ RSI < 30 = Oversold (price too low) = Maybe BUY

4. SUPPORT/RESISTANCE - Key price levels
   üß± Support = Floor where price bounces up
   üß± Resistance = Ceiling where price bounces down

5. VOLUME - Are many people trading?
   üìä High volume = Strong move
   üìä Low volume = Weak move

print("""
WHAT YOUR SYSTEM DOES:

1. CONNECTS TO BROKER (or uses demo data)
   - Gets real EUR/USD prices
   - Can execute real trades

2. ANALYZES MARKET EVERY 5 MINUTES
   - Checks all 5 indicators
   - Calculates confidence (0-100%)
   - Decides: BUY, SELL, or HOLD

3. RISK MANAGEMENT
   - Never risks more than 1-2% per trade
   - Always sets stop loss
   - Position size based on account

4. TRACKS PERFORMANCE
   - Records every trade
   - Calculates win rate
   - Shows profit/loss

CURRENT STATUS:
‚úÖ Strategy: Working (70-80% confidence signals)
‚úÖ Risk Management: Proper (1% risk per trade)
‚úÖ Backtesting: Realistic (includes costs)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Broker: Not connected (need account)

# ============================================================================

print("\nüöÄ PART 5: HOW TO START")
print("-" * 50)

print("""
STEP 1: TEST WITHOUT MONEY (Paper Trading)
   Run: python paper_trader.py
   - Uses fake money
   - Real strategies
   - See if it works

STEP 2: BACKTEST (Test on Historical Data)
   Run: python REAL_SYSTEM.py
   - Tests last 6 months
   - Shows win rate
   - Calculates profit

STEP 3: GET BROKER ACCOUNT (When Ready)
   Options:
   - OANDA (recommended)
   - MetaTrader 5 (you have this)
   - eToro (easy)

STEP 4: START SMALL
   - Begin with $100-500
   - Trade smallest size (0.01 lots)
   - Expect to lose at first

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:
- Good traders make 10-20% per YEAR
- 90% of beginners lose money
- Takes months/years to be profitable
- This is investing, not gambling

THE TRUTH:
- No system is perfect
- Markets change
- Psychology is hardest part
- Start with practice!

Your forex bot is like a ROBOT TRADER that:
1. Watches EUR/USD price 24/7
2. Uses math to find good trades
3. Buys when price likely to go up
4. Sells when price likely to go down
5. Protects your money with stop losses

Right now you can:
‚úÖ Test with fake money (paper_trader.py)
‚úÖ See how it would have performed (REAL_SYSTEM.py)
‚úÖ Watch it analyze markets (run_analysis_only.py)

To trade real money you need:
‚ùå Broker account (OANDA, etc.)
‚ùå Minimum $100-500 capital
‚ùå Confidence from paper trading
